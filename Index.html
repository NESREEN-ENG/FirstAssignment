            Shopping is one of my favorite activities. I love to browse through stores and find new things to buy.
             I also enjoy finding good deals on items.
             One of my favorite shopping trips is when I go to a mall and find several stores that have sales.
             I can spend hours looking for the best deals.

            reading is a reading comprehension/visual memory exercise to help individuals who can decode words adequately enough, but do not remember what they read. 
            In some cases it can give a child reading comprehension in just 30 days. It is a powerful intervention.

            Photography is the art of taking pictures with a device called a camera. 
            These pictures can be either stored as a soft copy or they can be printed on photographic papers,
             into copies called photographs. Till a few decades ago, photography was an entirely different process of work.
